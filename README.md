My very first public program! It's just a random Telegram bot that uses <a href="https://github.com/atipugin/telegram-bot-ruby">atiplugins's telegram-bot-ruby<a/> to work. I don't know if you use GitHub to upload this kind of stuff but I'm just gonna do it.

If you want to try it, follow this steps:


* Create a new bot on Telegram (Searching for @BotFather)

* Use /token on @BotFather and copy that token

* Go to dependencies/gen-dep.rb and change TOKEN for your token

* Change NAME to the name of your bot.

* You're ready!
